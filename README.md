# Automated-powerlevel10k-install
shell file to automatically installing the powerlevel10k theme

# installation:
```shell
 git clone https://github.com/germanex3000-hacker/Automated-powerlevel10k-install.git
```
```shell
cd Automated-powerlevel10k-install
```
```shell
bash install.sh
```

That should do it.\

Please ignore my bad readme. This is my first repo and I just read the doc for less than a minute.
Have a good day and don't forget to touch grass :)
