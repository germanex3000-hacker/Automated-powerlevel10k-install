# Automated-powerlevel10k-install
shell file to automatically installing the powerlevel10k theme

# installation:

` git clone https://github.com/germanex3000-hacker/Automated-powerlevel10k-install.git`
` cd Automated-powerlevel10k-install`
` bash install.sh`
That should do it.

Please ignore my bad readme. This is my first repo and I just read the doc for less than a minute.
Have a good day and don't forget to touch grass :)
